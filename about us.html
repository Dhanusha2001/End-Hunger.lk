<center><p1>
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was endorsed by all UN Member States in 2015, is focused on achieving peace and prosperity for people and the planet.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are 17 action points put out in the agenda to "free the human race from the tyranny of poverty" and "move the world onto a sustainable and resilient path" by 2030.
Zero Hunger is the second Sustainable Development Goal.
We are a key player in efforts to achieve <strong>SDG 2</strong>, which seeks to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture, by feeding over 100 million of the world's poorest people and assisting millions more around the world to improve their nutrition and build sustainable livelihoods.
