                Water supplies are a major issue for impoverished families. In this part of Bangladesh, we experience a water crisis during the dry season – from the end of November through April or May.
                </br>
                </br>
                Our donors’ support has helped us dig wells that provide clean and sanitized water at the rural communities. We maintain these wells to ensure a permanent source of clean water.
                </br>
                </br>
                The cost of tube well installation varies depending on the level of underground water is different in areas. The cost is $250 for normal areas in Bangladesh, $500 in cyclone affected areas.

<h>Feed the hungry</h>
</br>
</br>
<p1>
Millions of youngsters all over the world go to school hungry every day. Millions more children are also unable to attend school because their families require them to assist in the fields or do domestic responsibilities.
</br>
</br>
We've worked with over 30 countries to establish sustainable national school feeding programs and have a lot of expertise supporting school feeding and health efforts.
</br>
</br>
We will provide nutritious meals and snacks to 06 million pupils by 2020. We assisted 20 countries in strengthening their national school feeding programs, benefiting an additional 15 million children, by working with governments to create capacity. We're also proud supporters of the School Meals Coalition, which aims to improve or restore national, sustainable school meal programs by 2030, ensuring that every kid has access to a good, nutritional lunch at school.

<h>COVID-19 Emergency</h>
</br>
</br>
<p1>
As the coronavirus shakes the entire world, the crisis is also hitting the economy and lives of people in Afica hard. The situation in Africa remains highly vulnerable as hundreds of thousands of people are at high risk of disease spreading. The poor and needy people fear the lack of employment and income with restricted mobility.
</br>
</br>
With the ongoing pandemic, the Refugees at the our camp are at greater risk due to overcrowding and lack of sanitation.
</br>
</br>
We provided emergency aid and food assistance to the needy African people as well as refugees. We provided them safety items- masks, gloves, sanitizers.
</br>
</br>
Furthermore, an adequate amount of PPE was provided to the government authority for distribution to health service providers who are serving medical care to the sick at their own risk.
