            <h1>Save lives with Clean Water</h1>
            <p> supplies are a major issue for impoverished families. In this part of Bangladesh, we experience a water crisis during the dry season – from the end of November through April or May.<br><br>

            Our donors’ support has helped us dig wells that provide clean and sanitized water at the rural communities. We maintain these wells to ensure a permanent source of clean water.<br><br>
            
            The cost of tube well installation varies depending on the level of underground water is different in areas. The cost is $250 for normal areas in Bangladesh, $500 in cyclone affected areas.

            <h1>Feed the hungry</h1>
            <p> Millions of youngsters all over the world go to school hungry every day. Millions more children are also unable to attend school because their families require them to assist in the fields or do domestic responsibilities.
            </br>
            </br>
            We've worked with over 30 countries to establish sustainable national school feeding programs and have a lot of expertise supporting school feeding and health efforts.
            </br>
            </br>
            We will provide nutritious meals and snacks to 06 million pupils by 2020. We assisted 20 countries in strengthening their national school feeding programs, benefiting an additional 15 million children, by working with governments to create capacity. We're also proud supporters of the School Meals Coalition, which aims to improve or restore national, sustainable school meal programs by 2030, ensuring that every kid has access to a good, nutritional lunch at school.

            <h1>COVID-19 Emergency</h1>
            <p>
                As the coronavirus shakes the entire world, the crisis is also hitting the economy and lives of people in Afica hard. The situation in Africa remains highly vulnerable as hundreds of thousands of people are at high risk of disease spreading. The poor and needy people fear the lack of employment and income with restricted mobility.
            </br>
            </br>
            With the ongoing pandemic, the Refugees at the our camp are at greater risk due to overcrowding and lack of sanitation.
        </br>
        </br>
        We provided emergency aid and food assistance to the needy African people as well as refugees. We provided them safety items- masks, gloves, sanitizers.
        </br>
        </br>
        Furthermore, an adequate amount of PPE was provided to the government authority for distribution to health service providers who are serving medical care to the sick at their own risk.

            <h1>Meal Packaging Events</h1>
            <p> A series of meal packing events, where volunteers package the meals, is a key component of the initiative. Rice, soya, dehydrated vegetable mix, and a fortification pack of 23 vital minerals and vitamins specifically created to prevent malnutrition make up the highly nutritious meals (complying with the UNICEF standard).
            </br>
            </br>
            Volunteers can participate in the meal packaging event as a fun and engaging approach to help eradicate child hunger. In less than two hours, 40 volunteers can package 10,000 meals! Children as young as four years old to older people are among our volunteers. A Community Service Certificate is given to students who volunteer.
            </br>
            </br>
            We can grow the event from one benefiting a single ECD to a series of packaging events benefiting a whole community because of the efficiencies of hosting meal packing events.

            <h1>Supply Chain</h1>
            <p> We are on the front lines of the fight against hunger at all times. Thousands of committed employees channel their knowledge and use all available resources trucks, planes, ships, helicopters to ensure that large quantities of food and other necessary commodities reach those in need.
                We are a partner of choice in humanitarian response and, increasingly, in the drive to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, with 30 years of expertise delivering food assistance in some of the world's most distant and insecure locations.
                
                
            
                </br>
                </br>
                We assist our contracted retailers in optimizing their transportation and bulk-buying tactics in cash operations so that they can save costs and lower shelf prices. This means that both our recipients and the local people will have more purchasing power, allowing them to buy more and more nutritious food. Our planning, sourcing, and delivery processes maximize donor resources while also assisting in the professionalization of commercial marketplaces, resulting in increased economic growth.
                We continue to bridge the gap between humanitarian and development contexts while refining emergency response technologies. We seek long-term solutions to the underlying causes of crises, invest in more viable markets, and develop stronger commercial sectors in collaboration with governments and other partners.

            <h1>Food and nutrition assistance</h1>
            <p> We are at the forefront of preventing and treating malnutrition where it threatens the world's most vulnerable people.
                Our strategy is multi-pronged, with programs addressing the immediate causes of malnutrition, such as inadequate diets, as well as underlying problems, such as a lack of information about feeding practices or a lack of clean water. We focus our efforts on the most vulnerable populations, such as young children, pregnant women, breastfeeding moms, and HIV-positive persons.
                Through our Fill the Nutrient Gap situation analysis tool, we seek to enhance the availability and access to nutritious foods, as well as identify and address the challenges that individuals encounter in eating healthy diets. We contribute to the broader policy discourse on food and nutrition security by assisting nations in developing their capacity to find long-term solutions.
                </br>
                </br>
                With today's complex and unprecedented problems, no single organization will be able to eradicate malnutrition on its own. We are dedicated to participating in inter-organizational initiatives and platforms such as the Committee on World Food Security, the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition, and government-led partnerships with UN agencies, NGOs, civil society, businesses, and academia, as well as local farmers, producers, retailers, and communities. We also play a key role in attracting commercial sector partners into the battle against malnutrition.
