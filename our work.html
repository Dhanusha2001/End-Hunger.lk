                Water supplies are a major issue for impoverished families. In this part of Bangladesh, we experience a water crisis during the dry season – from the end of November through April or May.
                </br>
                </br>
                Our donors’ support has helped us dig wells that provide clean and sanitized water at the rural communities. We maintain these wells to ensure a permanent source of clean water.
                </br>
                </br>
                The cost of tube well installation varies depending on the level of underground water is different in areas. The cost is $250 for normal areas in Bangladesh, $500 in cyclone affected areas.

<h>Feed the hungry</h>
</br>
</br>
<p1>
Millions of youngsters all over the world go to school hungry every day. Millions more children are also unable to attend school because their families require them to assist in the fields or do domestic responsibilities.
</br>
</br>
We've worked with over 30 countries to establish sustainable national school feeding programs and have a lot of expertise supporting school feeding and health efforts.
</br>
</br>
We will provide nutritious meals and snacks to 06 million pupils by 2020. We assisted 20 countries in strengthening their national school feeding programs, benefiting an additional 15 million children, by working with governments to create capacity. We're also proud supporters of the School Meals Coalition, which aims to improve or restore national, sustainable school meal programs by 2030, ensuring that every kid has access to a good, nutritional lunch at school.

<h>COVID-19 Emergency</h>
</br>
</br>
<p1>
As the coronavirus shakes the entire world, the crisis is also hitting the economy and lives of people in Afica hard. The situation in Africa remains highly vulnerable as hundreds of thousands of people are at high risk of disease spreading. The poor and needy people fear the lack of employment and income with restricted mobility.
</br>
</br>
With the ongoing pandemic, the Refugees at the our camp are at greater risk due to overcrowding and lack of sanitation.
</br>
</br>
We provided emergency aid and food assistance to the needy African people as well as refugees. We provided them safety items- masks, gloves, sanitizers.
</br>
</br>
Furthermore, an adequate amount of PPE was provided to the government authority for distribution to health service providers who are serving medical care to the sick at their own risk.

<h>Innovation and digital transformation</h>
</br>
</br>
<p1>
We are expansion and growth technology and data responsibly to achieve zero hunger by 2030. Through our Fast IT and Telecommunications Disaster and Support Team (FITTEST) and as the lead agency for the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster, we use drones to improve response in humanitarian emergencies and allow connectivity in emergency situations (ETC).
</br>
</br>
With our cloud-based platform, SCOPE, we ensure that the correct individual receives the right benefit, while also harnessing blockchain and real-time data to better the coordination and distribution of aid across the humanitarian sector. 
</br>
</br>
Our Munich-based Innovation Accelerator has been testing novel hunger-fighting technologies since its inception in 2015.

<h>Meal Packaging Events</h>
</br>
</br>
<p1>
A series of meal packing events, where volunteers package the meals, is a key component of the initiative. Rice, soya, dehydrated vegetable mix, and a fortification pack of 23 vital minerals and vitamins specifically created to prevent malnutrition make up the highly nutritious meals (complying with the UNICEF standard).
</br>
</br>
Volunteers can participate in the meal packaging event as a fun and engaging approach to help eradicate child hunger. In less than two hours, 40 volunteers can package 10,000 meals! Children as young as four years old to older people are among our volunteers. A Community Service Certificate is given to students who volunteer.
</br>
</br>
We can grow the event from one benefiting a single ECD to a series of packaging events benefiting a whole community because of the efficiencies of hosting meal packing events.

<h>Supply Chain</h>
</br>
</br>
<p1>
We are on the front lines of the fight against hunger at all times. Thousands of committed employees channel their knowledge and use all available resources trucks, planes, ships, helicopters to ensure that large quantities of food and other necessary commodities reach those in need.
We are a partner of choice in humanitarian response and, increasingly, in the drive to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, with 30 years of expertise delivering food assistance in some of the world's most distant and insecure locations.
</br>
</br>
We collaborate with governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as suppliers and local communities. We work with enterprises and small-scale farms. We put money into local economies, marketplaces, and businesses.
We contribute to more sustainable farming systems, more vibrant retail sectors, and more resilient transportation networks by prioritizing local enterprises and national first responders as much as possible for both our disaster relief and our resilience-building programs. We spend more than $2 million in the countries where we operate through our supply chain, plugging gaps in local supply chains when needed.
</br>
</br>
We assist our contracted retailers in optimizing their transportation and bulk-buying tactics in cash operations so that they can save costs and lower shelf prices. This means that both our recipients and the local people will have more purchasing power, allowing them to buy more and more nutritious food. Our planning, sourcing, and delivery processes maximize donor resources while also assisting in the professionalization of commercial marketplaces, resulting in increased economic growth.
We continue to bridge the gap between humanitarian and development contexts while refining emergency response technologies. We seek long-term solutions to the underlying causes of crises, invest in more viable markets, and develop stronger commercial sectors in collaboration with governments and other partners.

<h>Food and nutrition assistance</h>
</br>
</br>
<p1>
We are at the forefront of preventing and treating malnutrition where it threatens the world's most vulnerable people.
Our strategy is multi-pronged, with programs addressing the immediate causes of malnutrition, such as inadequate diets, as well as underlying problems, such as a lack of information about feeding practices or a lack of clean water. We focus our efforts on the most vulnerable populations, such as young children, pregnant women, breastfeeding moms, and HIV-positive persons.
Through our Fill the Nutrient Gap situation analysis tool, we seek to enhance the availability and access to nutritious foods, as well as identify and address the challenges that individuals encounter in eating healthy diets. We contribute to the broader policy discourse on food and nutrition security by assisting nations in developing their capacity to find long-term solutions.
</br>
</br>
With today's complex and unprecedented problems, no single organization will be able to eradicate malnutrition on its own. We are dedicated to participating in inter-organizational initiatives and platforms such as the Committee on World Food Security, the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition, and government-led partnerships with UN agencies, NGOs, civil society, businesses, and academia, as well as local farmers, producers, retailers, and communities. We also play a key role in attracting commercial sector partners into the battle against malnutrition.

<h>Cash transfers</h>
</br>
</br>
<p1>
If markets and the financial system are functioning, cash transfers can be an effective strategy to attain food security and nutrition results.
We use cash transfers to give people the option of meeting their basic needs in local markets while also working to enhance those markets. In 2020, we gave a record-breaking US$2.1 million in purchasing power to individuals in 31 countries. This accounted for 37% of our entire assistance portfolio for the year.
</br>
</br>
To promote greater synergy, effectiveness, and efficiency in attaining goals, our integrated programs comprise tightly linked activities and cooperation with partners. For example, cash is used in larger food aid programs with the goal of boosting the market, financial sector, and retailers, as well as financial inclusion and gender equality - all of which contribute to enhanced food security. Between January 2017 and June 2018, the purchasing power of cash users rose by US $ 27 million in Bangladesh, Kenya, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq as part of the retail strengthening component of cash programs.
